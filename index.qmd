:::{#hero-heading}
**I am a researcher and PhD candidate at the Finnish Environment Institute (Syke), working on deep learning and computer vision for or environmental monitoring.**

My work focuses on topics like fine-grained classification, out-of-distribution detection and multimodal learning from images, videos and DNA data, with applications in biodiversity monitoring and remote sensing.

I hold a MSc in Electrical Engineering from Tampere University, with a major in Signal Processing. During my studies I completed internships at Intel, where I worked with 3A algorithms, and at Vaisala, focusing on deep learning methods for predictive maintenance.

I am a member in several expert groups, including:

- **EIONET Data and Digitalization** (European Environment Agency).
- **Lukki**, Finland's national coordination group for nature information.
- **GEO AI4EO**, a GEO subgroup focused on geospatial AI for Earth Observation.
